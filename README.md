Hey users, this new repository was coded in python, and developed to convert lowercase to uppercase/caps locked text. To use it, run the program and input your text when ready ðŸ˜ƒ.

P.S. - Don't input uppercase unless you want the program to break - I have released the [same code](https://github.com/R1sh1Par1kh/uppercase-to-lowercase) except everything is vice versa.
